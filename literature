- IAc and IAw positively correlated across the whole sample and IAw strongly positively correlated with several MAIA subscales. Significant negative correlations were also found with state anxiety and depressive symptoms. Female subjects exhibited a different interoceptive pattern with a negative relationship between IAc and BMI, and IAw and state anxiety. Conversely, male subjects exhibited a positive relationship between IAw and BMI, and IAc and Age, while IAw showed a negative relationship with state anxiety and depression.

- Specifically, patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder compared with healthy participants exhibited a significantly higher interoceptive sensitivity for NSCFs. No evidence for higher interoceptive sensitivity in PHA (neither in the heartbeat mental tracking task nor in the NSCF task) was observed after accounting for comorbid anxiety disorders. Interoceptive sensitivity might not be specific to health anxiety but rather associated with factors shared with anxiety disorders. Interoceptive processing appears more specific to health anxiety.

- Existing research indicates an association between low interoceptive sensitivity and alexithymia. Atypical interoception underlies the onset of psychopathology and risky behavior in adolescence, and the decreased socio-emotional competence observed in late adulthood.

- Evidence suggests that variability in interoception interacts with higher-order psychological functions such as self, other, and emotion processing. Early life stress might adversely affect central interoceptive representation and psychosocial functioning in BPD.

- Neurobiological overview of interoception and describe how interoceptive impairments at different levels relate to specific physical and mental health conditions, including sickness behaviors and fatigue, depression, eating disorders, autism, and anxiety.

- Deficits in interoception may decrease the likelihood that satiety signals are integrated into eating behavior related decision making and in doing so contribute to higher BMI.

**Zamariola, et al., 2018**  
[DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2017.12.024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.12.024)  
- It is largely assumed that alexithymia relates negatively both to subjective and objective interoception. Results showed a weak negative correlation between alexithymia and IS but no correlation between alexithymia and IAcc.

**Shah, et al., 2016**  
[DOI: 10.1186/s13229-016-0104-x](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-016-0104-x)  
- Alexithymia is thought to arise due to impaired interoception. These results demonstrate that although framing effects are associated with interoception and alexithymia in the neurotypical population, emotional and interoceptive signals have less impact upon the decision-making process in ASD.

**Brewer, et al., 2016**  
[DOI: 10.1098/rsos.150664](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.150664)  
- Alexithymia was associated with poor non-affective interoception and increased perceived similarity between affective and non-affective states, in both the typical and clinical populations. We therefore suggest that rather than being specifically associated with affective impairment, alexithymia is better characterized by a general failure of interoception.

- Evidence for a substantial independence of the IAc and IAw measures, confirming previous reports and current theoretical models that differentiate between IAc and IAw. Our analyses elucidate the complex relationship between distinct dimensions of IAw and ES, highlighting the need for continued efforts to shed more light on this topic.
